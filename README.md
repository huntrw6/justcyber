# Welcome to the CTF workshop for the Just Cyber Team


### Bethel School of Technology: 2023 CSO110 Final Group Project - Matthew, Hunter, & Jessica

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a type of game or competition that challenges participants to solve various cyber security challenges and puzzles, with the ultimate goal of capturing a "flag," which is a digital token or key that represents a successful breach or exploit.
CTF challenges can range from cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, binary exploitation, network analysis, and other areas of cybersecurity. The challenges are designed to test the participants' technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.


### Overview of Flags
Easy: Basic computer knowledge

Medium: Applies intermediate-level tools/technical knowledge

Hard: Requires a niche tool or concept to solve

root: most difficult flag to complete since it consists of multiple steps, and root access to the flag in one way or another.
